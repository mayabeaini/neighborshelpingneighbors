Disclaimer:

1. please note that the database set up might cause some errors because I don't know if the ids are gonna get mixed up!

2. the front end is not as dynamic as I would like it to be since the login is not yet connected to back, so the get ids are manually put inside the app!

3. Delivery page might be empty because no items have been assigned to orders, since they have been done locally by me, I am assuming they aren't gonna be uploaded to git hub

4. there are no sign up but also the login feature is not yet connected to the database so that won't cause any errors

5. total price is manually put and functionality is set for phase 2.

HINT: if you don't have gmail then just put in the url /search or anything other than /profile or / or /login

6. facebook login is set for phase 2 as well

7. adding amount to each item is set for phase 2
